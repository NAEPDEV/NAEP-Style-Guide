/**
* @styles 1-sb-grid Grid
* The grid used for shape builder responses has the same styling as typical [coordinate-grids.css], with the following exceptions:
* * The grid border has the same style as grid lines (i.e., medium-weight gray `#949494` lines).
* * Axes, axis labels, axis names, and axis ticks are not provided.
* * The origin label is replaced by a zero aligned with the vertical and horizontal axis labels.
*
* Line segments and circles have the same styles and behaviors as draggable [points-lines-polygons.css], with two exceptions:
* * The center point of each circle is used to translate the circle.
* * The outer point of each circle receives the `ew-move` cursor since it transforms the circle in only one dimension.

* * The __Reset__ button restores the grid to its initial state.
