The recommended minimum touch target size for most user interface controls in eNAEP adheres to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#target-size" target="_blank">WCAG&#160;2.1 success criterion 2.5.5</a>: 44 by 44 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#reference-pixel" target="_blank">CSS pixels</a>, which translates roughly to 11.4mmÂ² with 2mm padding between targets, as rendered on the delivery device. The following exceptions are allowed:
* The functionality of the control is available through an equivalent control on the same screen that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels.
* The target is in a sentence or block of text (e.g., [short-text-popups.css]).
* The particular presentation of the control is essential to the information being conveyed.
