## Scope
The UX section of the style guide covers the visual styles and core behaviors of student-facing user interface (UI) elements in the eNAEP delivery platform. It includes information about UI elements in:
* Discrete items
* Scenario-based tasks (SBTs)
* Interactive item components (IICs)

This section does _not_ cover styles or conventions for item content, which are addressed in the item development and media sections. Examples of item content styles not covered in this section include:
* The appearance of reading passages or other stimuli
* Colors, layout, and other visual details of tables, charts, and other images embedded in item content
* Use of text styling (i.e., bolding, italics, underline), lists, line and paragraph breaks, etc.

### SBT Styles <img src="static/img/icon-asterisk.svg"/>
SBTs engage students with a particular context and ask them to complete a series of activities in service of a larger purpose or task. To achieve those design goals, SBTs often have custom interactions and styling. UI elements and conventions found only in SBTs are covered in the SBT-specific pages. In addition, headings with a blue asterisk icon elsewhere in this section describe modifications or exceptions to default conventions that may be used to suit the needs of a given SBT.

## Features
The UX section includes three key features that supplement the textual descriptions of UI styles and behaviors:
* Embedded static and interactive demos of all UI elements
* The <img src="static/img/icon-theme.svg" style="max-height: 1.75em; max-width: 1.75em;" />__Change Theme__ button (at the upper right), which controls the color theme applied to the demos on the current page. (See the [color-themes.md] page for more information.)
* The <img src="static/img/icon-tts.svg" style="max-height: 1.75em; max-width: 1.75em;"/>__Text-to-speech__ button (also at the upper right), which allows the user to see TTS-speakable content and how TTS mode otherwise interacts with UI elements. (See the [tts.css] page for more information.)


The change log for the UX section can be found on the [version-history.md] page.
