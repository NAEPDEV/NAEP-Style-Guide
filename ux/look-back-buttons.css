* Items sometimes refer to a defined piece (i.e., a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, or section) of a stimulus passage. When the measurement goal of the item is to assess test takersâ€™ ability to use the referenced piece of text as the basis for interpretation or evaluation (as opposed to their ability to _locate_ it), a look-back button is provided in the text of the item. When pressed, a look-back button:
* * Auto-navigates the passage to the referenced piece of text.
* * Highlights the referenced piece of text. The default highlight color is a semi-transparent light blue `rgba(125,189,255,0.5)`, but other colors may be used to avoid contrast compliance issues.
* * Causes the highlighting on the piece of text to flash twice to bring attention to it.
* * In the [environment-ereader.css] environment, the look-back button will close the item panel before triggering the events above.
*
* Look-back button highlighting remains visible until the test taker navigates to another item. If test takers return to the item with the look-back button, they must press it again to see the highlighting.
*
* Look-back buttons are presented as secondary filled buttons (see the [buttons.css] page for more information) with custom sizing so they do not disrupt the line spacing of the surrounding text.
